My name's nicaise, and I'm a student at sayna, a digital school where you can learn the digital professions. We have the values of family, fun and challenge. I'm interested in community management even though I'm not a marketer. I'm still learning a lot about the field and especially the techniques for learning it. That's why I'm looking to collaborate on different projects with different methods in almost all parts of the world.
